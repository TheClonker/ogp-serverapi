# OpenGamePanel Server API

Just a simple api to list all servers on a OGP Website

Returns all Servers as JSON Objects with the attributes:
* server_id
* server_name
* name
* game
* ip
* port
* path
* remote_server_id
* remote_server_name
* running

This is a very rough start with a hardcoded key and not much documentation

Issues and Pull Request are more than welcome :)
